<h2>How It All Started</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">I moved to San Francisco a couple years ago when I came out for a Quantified Self conference — the minute I got here, I fell in love with California, and canceled my return flight. Probably one of the craziest things I’ve ever done. I had absolutely nowhere to stay, I knew probably two other people out in SF, and I was just coming off the tail end of a big project. After a few day of AirBnb-ing, I ended up crashing at a hacker hostel in deep SOMA (fun fact: I had never seen another human’s feces until then, thanks SOMA!). The very first week I moved into the hacker hostel, someone managed to break in and hi-jack a bunch of relatively expensive bikes. Being the engineer that I am, I made a quick-n-dirty prototype for a bike tracker using some hardware (Arduino!) I had lying around, plus a couple other things I had to grab on <a href="http://sparkfun.com">Sparkfun</a>.</p>

<p>I’m not a particularly good engineer, but I know enough to be dangerous, so putting together a rudimentary prototype wasn’t particularly challenging, however I knew there was absolutely no way I would be able to design a production-ready piece of hardware, so that product pretty much stopped before it started.<br><br>Plus I had realized that bike tracker market isn’t huge. So I let the project sit off to the side.</p>

<h2>Finding the Problem</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">I go to Barcelona for <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com">Mobile World Congress</a> every year because I’m a huge nerd; and that year I happened to overhear that someone was having problems with their shipping containers being stolen. Considering my experience in the bike tracking world, that idea sparked some interest. I did a little bit of research to size the market, and the numbers that I stumbled upon almost convinced me that I might be able to make something interesting with the prototype I already had.</p>
<figure class="image-container" style="width: 50%; float: left; margin: 10 30 12 0; max-width: 345px; max-height: 445 px"><img src="http://buildingof.com/assets/weft-second-prototype-blurred.png" width="20%" height"10%"><figcaption>The hardware prototype that was developed for tracking shipping containers.</figcaption></figure>
<p>$35B worth of value gets destroyed every year in the US due to shrinkage (theft, spoilage, etc.). Those are some nice numbers to play around with and I honestly thought that we could re-purpose the hardware that we’d already created (with a couple extra sensors) to track not only the location of a shipping container but also its environment, theoretically reducing all the waste due to cargo shrink; but the fact that there was so much competition in the market really put me off. So I let the project sit some more.</p>

<p>However, the fact that there was so much competition in the market really put me off. And I still wasn’t convinced it was worth tackling, as the existing players in the market seemed well-entrenched and I suspected that it was going to be a difficult market to crack.</p>
<p>Eventually I found myself at the very first <a href="http://siliconvalley.startupweekend.org/">Enterprise Startup Weekend</a> ever (I started my first company at one years ago, so I like to show up to these every once in a while). It didn’t seem like my skillset was incredibly valuable to the folks there, so I decided to spend a little bit of time imagining a solid use case for the hardware I had made.</p>
<p>At this point, I’d done a bunch of customer development and one of the major things that came up in conversation was the fact that nobody inside of the supply chain knew what was going on, so I whipped together a full-stack logistics visibility tool that was augmented by my hardware — and with that I got first place! That was my first false validation that what I was building actually meant something, but it sent me down a path that landed me to where I am today, so I could not be more grateful for that validation. We’ve definitely refined the product quite a bit since then (after bringing together a great team, running some pilots, and even raising some seed capital) and the longer I spend in Logistics, the more I learn that there’s a whole lot left to automate.</p>
 <blockquote class="pullquote">my prior experience &amp; professional network helped land seed funding and the pilots.<br>

<h2>The Market</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">Logistics is a big-ass industry (that’s a technical term) and there are generally a lot of people that touch the shipping process. As a result of sheer number of interacting parts, there are countless areas that can be optimized and automated, ranging from pre-shipping, to the actual shipping, and processing at ports of arrival. Heck, logistics as we know it today is a relatively recent thing; it was only the 1970s when someone realized that having an indivisible, standard unit of shipments would be able to reduce loading time by multiple orders of magnitude! Before the shipping container it would take days to load a container ship, now it only takes hours! There are still a lot of areas within logistics to left to optimize, we just thought a good start would be to make sure that everybody in the supply chain is on the same page.</p>
<p>This extends to the entire shipping process, as there are losses incurred by shippers and ports due to various inefficiencies, whether delays, errors, inefficient routing, underutilization of capacity, and so on.</p>
 <blockquote class="pullquote">We simply wanted to provide a service to help make sure that everybody was on the same page.<br>
</blockquote>

<h2>Our Thoughts</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph"><a href="http://weft.io">Weft</a> is a canonical example of the gradual refinement product. Your vision is amplified by immersion &amp; increase of familiarity with a particular market, in response to which you refine your product, incorporating the information that is unlocked as you proceed.</p>
<p>In other words, discovering all an industry entails, its intricacies and peculiarities—immersing yourself in it, enables you to create the ideal product to tackle a particular problem.</p>
 <blockquote class="pullquote">Just ensure that the market is large enough to make it a worthwhile pursuit.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>The opportunities and their accompanying challenges ahead of Weft in the logistics industry are quite substantial, and we wish Weft and the Weft team the best of luck.</p>
