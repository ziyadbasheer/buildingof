      <section class="gist">
      </section>

<p class="first-paragraph">From a golf course-side lemonade stand I ran when I was 8 to a door-to-door car washing service I created when I was 12, up until I registered my first “real” business&mdash;a website development agency&mdash;at the age of 16, I’ve been selling since I learned to talk.</p>
<p>Every business I’ve ever created has been B2B because my way of thinking resonates much better with other businesses as opposed to consumers, that’s where I feel most comfortable. B2B work is more about providing value and building a long term relationship, whereas B2C is?</p>
<p>PBX.me has actually been a very long process. I initially tried to start the service in 2008, but the market just wasn’t ready for it yet, and there were a lot of good reasons it didn’t work back then:<br>
<ul>
<li>VOIP had a terrible reputation that it 100% deserved.</li>
<li>Internet speeds were not fast enough to support VOIP at all businesses.</li>
<li>Mobile data was too slow and too expensive to support VOIP.</li>
<li>Not enough ground had been broken in the industry yet&mdash;just six years ago, the cost was going to be 20 to 30 times greater than it is today.</li>
<li>Not enough businesses were using smart phones.</li>
<li>Smart phones were not powerful or reliable enough yet.</li></ul></p>
<blockquote class="pullquote">After about six months of exploring all of the options, I decided that it wasn’t the right time and shelved the idea.</blockquote>

<p>Over the next five years, I went on to a variety of other successful business ventures, including Mango Ideas, GSID.net, RedRocket, and RedStamp  Agency – my full-service marketing agency that continues to kick ass and take names. But I never stopped spending time brainstorming ideas, talking to people about their concerns, and observing and studying the user patterns, so I would be ready when the rest of the world caught up. </p>

<p>In fact, PBX.me is one of the main reasons that I founded RedStamp; there were others (it helped me to hone and practice my marketing/B2B/startup skills on a daily basis for clients, brought in a nice revenue stream once people saw that we were putting out quality work, and enabled me to get into business with @sririe, the partner who’s been working with me pretty much since we both started working), but creating RedStamp allowed me to build a tech team that would be capable of a venture like PBX.me.</p>

<p>I did all of this because I knew this type of business would one day be something that I could make successful. I could spot the technology trends and tell that the world was headed in this direction&mdash;just like we’ll all be driving electric cars once the technology comes of age and the various logistical problems are resolved.</p>

<blockquote class="pullquote">For PBX.me, that time came in 2013.</blockquote>
<p>All of the previous issues were not only gone, they were and still are continuing to improve (faster internet, the rapid growth of smartphone use, LTE for mobile, and so on). In the interim, I had also co-founded and spent three years running a marketing agency that worked directly with the market we wanted to target, creating marketing campaigns and offering web development and branding services. This translated to vital connections (I got to work with several of the CEOs on Forbes Top 25 Under 25, former Symantec execs, and a bunch of people from MIT and Ivy League schools) and a good working knowledge of the inner workings of a lot of different companies. </p>
<p>Leveraging these relationships has gone a long way towards allowing me to skip a seed round of funding for PBX.me, opting instead to self-fund it. And because investors are always looking to accelerate things and get the best possible product out there as fast as possible, self-funding has allowed me to focus the product development part of the process. </p>

<h2>Initial Inspiration</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">Prior to founding RedStamp, I built a managed hosting service because the startup I was involved with went under and a lot of their customers were left in the cold. (Ironically, this happened because I was too good at my job&mdash;I made too many sales and the startup just couldn’t </p>
<p>Being in that space, we would frequently be asked to setup asterisk VOIP servers so companies could use VOIP. In doing so, we’d often hear them complain about call quality, issues with scaling, integrations, and other problems. It became very clear to me that, though the need was there, the only solutions available were far from ideal. </p>
<p>Our entire system has been shaped by focusing on two main things:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Create a system that easily integrates with the things you already use.</li>
  <li>Make the entire experience easy and beautiful.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>Thinking about those two core values has helped us to create most of our best features:
<ul>
  <li>Telemarketer blocking</li>
  <li>Integration with most web apps</li>
  <li>Automatically to track calls into Salesforce</li>
  <li>Ability to use your smartphone for business calls</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges We Faced</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">As I mentioned earlier, before 2013, technology just wasn’t at a point where PBX.me was feasible or ready for the mass market. I’ve been very patient with my timing to ensure that I give this product the best possible chance.</p>
<p>As someone with a design background, but not one in software development per se, it was tough finding the right team on that end&mdash;that’s where having a strong network came in handy, I had made enough high-quality business connections in that world that I was able to bring in people who all came highly recommended from trusted colleagues. This gave me confidence in the team that I might not have otherwise had.</p>
 <blockquote class="pullquote" style="padding-bottom: 40px;">We needed to focus our efforts and resources on a specific segment of our potential customer pool.<br>
</blockquote>

<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">Since many of our team members are coming from a design agency, we’ve spent a lot of hours working on different UI concepts, colours, and so on. And because we’re perfectionists, we’ve also spent just as much time knocking them down and trying to find ways to make things easier and more intuitive.</p>

<p>We’re still pre-beta, so a lot of our data has come from market research and looking at what our competitors’ shortcomings are. Most of our changes have come from the mindset of making things simple. If it seems like it reduces friction, we’re happy to alter whatever we need to.</p>
<p>Things will become truly interesting once we hit beta, because we’ll get to see how right or wrong we are.  </p>
 <blockquote class="pullquote">We learned what our customers wanted, and we built it for them.<br>
</blockquote>

<h2>Finding a Foothold</h2>
<p>Being involved in the start-up community, running an agency, and being in the managed service provider space for many years has given me the advantage of having a very high quality network of people to bounce ideas off of.</p>

<p>While ultimately the only thing that validates this business model is our ability to get and keep paying customers, we know the market is already there, and our approach is very obvious. We also have more than 2,000 people subscribed to our pre-launch e-mail list, so there’s clearly a lot of interest in what we’re doing.</p>

<p>We’ve got a lot of things on our plate right now. Obviously, we’re working on finishing the beta. But in addition to that, we’re also working on marketing concepts and campaign ideas for the web, developing the best possible UI for the web dashboard, creating a backend/database code, and (of course) writing wonderful articles for sites like this. :)</p>

<p>After five years of waiting and planning, who would have thought that the final three months would be so exciting? Now that we can finally see the finish line, it’s a completely different mindset for the team. We’re all pumped about getting the product out there and letting the world see how amazing it is.</p>

<h2>Takeaways for Fellow Entrepreneurs</h2>
<p>Share your work and ideas frequently. No one is going to steal your idea. People are way too busy working on the million ideas they have to bother with yours. (expand more on why this expression o ideas boosts your status)</p>

<p>Spend the time to design beautifully – it will create an amazing first impression. Don’t buy into “MVP” being a free ticket that allows you to engage in crappy design practices. Focus more on the “V” and less on the “M.” You can limit your features and product reach, but whatever you do, don’t skimp on the design or overall experience planning – you need to impress people from the start! (opine on whether this is best or you need to just get something out there, depends on how much novelty vs utility it has, or rather, whether it's an -er product or a game changer.)</p>
