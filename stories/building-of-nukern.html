<p class="first-paragraph">My name is Philippe Rivard. I am an entrepreneur with 10+ years IT experience and I’ve also been a hosting reseller for more than 10 years.</p>
<p> I studied Program Analysis at College CDI in Montreal, Canada, where I spent most of my undergraduate time learning programming languages that I never ended up using. However, I still code&amp;PHP and Javascript mostly for friends who need a hand with their websites or clients who need to update theirs.</p>
<p>(How did you get in the situation that allowed you to see that opportunity? Were you employed at a company? Or were you a freelancer? E.g. After graduating from CDI, I was employed at or started doing)_______, and given my entrepreneurial nature, I saw an opportunity in web hosting while coding my first client’s website&mdash;after development, they needed to host it and the agency I was with at the time didn’t offer hosting services, whereas I was quite well versed due to x, so instead of just giving the hosting contract to someone, I thought I might as well learn how to host, (what made you think that you could simply do it yourself? Based on previous experience?) and make some profit out of it, which went pretty well. That was back in 2003.</p>


<h2>Initial Inspiration</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">While the hosting landscape has changed a lot in the past 10 years (what are some of the transient changes that you’ve seen during your time in the industry?), the needs are still the same. Reliable and easy interaction between a hosting company and their end-user (customer support) is among the main concerns, as are security, upgradeability, and maintenance of the hosted code. There’s also portability if you need to support your end-users on the road.</p>

<p>Who are we? You and your agency or the host you were working at/with? We tried them all because we were never entirely satisfied with the solution in place (why were the available solutions unsatisfactory for the organizations you were involved with? Most make do with what’s available, and those that are laser-focused on excellent build their own, which was the case here?). After trying the most popular solutions for billing and support, specifically made for the hosting industry, I decided it was time to have a real solution&mdash;something that would incorporate all of our needs inside a single and intuitive solution for both hosting providers and their end-users. So you developed this from an insider perspective, you were a host as you’ve explained in your bio, correct? Phrase that in.</p>

<h2>Challenges We Faced</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">Like I said above, we tried all the available solutions on the market. Nothing was really hitting the nail on the head (what I really want to understand is why you were to interested in finding a perfect solution while you were working in hosting?). I guess most of these solutions weren’t built from a web hosting providers’ point of view. What makes you say that?</p>

<p>At which point did your interest cross over from simply obtaining the best possible solution for the hosting company you were involved with to creating your own, and to going out and creating a product? Tell us more about that. So I did a lot of research on features, price and what current users liked about a particular solution. From there, I compiled all my research into the project currently known as Nukern and decided to build it. (What were some of the steps you took before realizing that you needed money? E.g. you considered what resources are needed to build such a product from the ground up, etc.) However, the reality is that without money, it’s hard to get somewhere, let alone find all-stars willing to work with you for just equity. One of my first challenges was to reach out to UX designers (for Nukern mockups) (why was UX important to you and your vision of nukern and why was it one of the first issues that you had to handle? I understand that the issue with existing services was largely manifested in poor UX, but please make that explicit) and convince someone to join the startup journey with me. After countless hours of research and browsing (where?), I reached out to whom I thought were the best in the industry around the world. I must’ve sent between 50-60 emails that day and I had a reply rate of 60%, which is pretty good. After exchanging a couple emails with them, I eliminated all but five based on way they answered my questions, their availability, they willingness to work for a startup, and then I took it to Skype. I decided to meet with a local UX designer in the city where I live, Montreal, that I thought was amazing, but had a smaller portfolio than most of the other guys. Locality certainly had something to do with my choice, but I was prepared to work with the best UX designer, even if it was remotely. </p>

<p>After a good face to face chat, we decided to embark on this adventure together. His name is Aurélien Salomon and he’s the best UX guy I came across.</p>

<p>Then, I went through the same steps to find a hosting infrastructure mastermind, this was an important part of our vision and strategy, (as we want to do x, e.g. build the best x possible and we need x to do that?). Good news is, I found the best possible partner here again. To be honest, I’ve always been looking to partner with another web hosting guru, either to host clients or to work on Nukern. Not that I think of myself as a guru, but I’m pretty knowledgeable, and I was looking for a partner who would complete me and consider the more the technical side of things with regard to Nukern.</p>

<p>After a lot of emails and meetings, he finally agreed to join the team through perseverance, good looking product mockups, a common interest and passion in web hosting and the right timing. His name is Simon Boulet and he’s also the former IT Director at iWeb — Quebec’s largest web hosting provider. </p>

<p>I faced many other challenges,  we had rocky start on a previous attempt to get Nukern off the ground with 3 other people, all working remotely. It’s also hard to get people excited about software for web hosting providers — I’m talking about Mentors and VCs. Most of the time, they see people talking about web or phone apps that anyone could find a use for. We’re very niche in the way that we are only targeting web hosting providers right now.</p>

<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p class="first-paragraph">We joined an accelerator (some see it as an incubator) called Founder Institute with Nukern, at the beginning of 2014, the team was pretty psyched! We were all excited that Nukern would get mentored and a network of contacts. It would also validate the idea in a way. And the experience we gained there has been one of the most beneficial experience we have ever had. We had to pitch our idea weekly to Mentors, VCs and founder peers. We were also graded on the pitch and idea quality. It really helped screen all the ideas I had for Nukern into something a lot more solid because everyone mentoring was either an experienced serial entrepreneur or an experienced VC, and we wouldn’t normally be able to get in touch with these guys. Founder Institute made it possible. All their comments and feedback were spot on and made us think further.</p>

<p>Our experience at Founder Institute also forced me to find a real differentiator from our competitors. So I had to pivot on a couple ideas, but Nukern’s core is still there in addition to two solid differentiators. Let’s just say it’s never been easier for hosting companies to manage their clients and the software. </p>
<p>Things will become truly interesting once we hit beta, because we’ll get to see how right or wrong we are.</p>

<p>All in all, we received very positive feedback for Nukern. The incredible help of Mentors and VCs from the program really helped us focus and head in the right direction. The whole team is eager to get to Alpha ASAP and show a working product to web hosting providers. All they have seen so far are screenshots of the product.</p>

<h2>Finding a Foothold</h2>
<p>Like I mentioned above, entrepreneurs and VCs from the Founder Institute had good words for Nukern. Plus I have 2 amazing partners working with me on the project. We have gathered a lot of interest from our Twitter account and landing page. We have more than 100 hosting providers registered to our mailing list — eagerly waiting to get their hands on some alpha or early beta.</p>

<p>We’re currently working on cPanel’s interaction with our software. cPanel is the control panel of choice for more than 80% of the web hosting market, so we want to make sure we got this covered from day one. Our vision is a seamless integration between Nukern and cPanel. It’s really more about not having to log into cPanel for their end-user. Only having to manage their Nukern (billing) account for all the end-user needs is our focus. We’re gonna server other control panels after cPanel, like Plesk for exemple, but since cPanel is such a big player, we’re tackling this one first.</p>

<p>A big thanks goes out to Ziyad from Building Of for reaching out to us. I hope you enjoyed theses tid-bits of information about our startup, Nukern. Our team is located in beautiful Montreal, Quebec. Feel free to reach out to us for any questions or comments: hi [at] nukern.com. We’d love to hear from all of you!
Cheers!
